<h1>Start from your previous Spotify Exercise.</h1>

<p>
  The goal of this exercise is to fetch data from the API instead of having
  them "wired up" in the page.
</p>

<p>Generate automatically 3 lists based on the "search API" response</p>
<ul>
  <li>es.: https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=eminem</li>
  <li>es.: https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=metallica</li>
  <li>es.: https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/search?q=behemoth</li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Load them during page load, and create the collections based on the API
  response.
</h3>

<h4>
  Make the central part of the page scrollable both horizontally and
  vertically
</h4>

<h4>
  Add a "List albums" button. When pressed, he should create and display a
  list of albums on the page
</h4>

<h4>
  Add a "Count Unique" button. When pressed, he should log the number of
  unique albums on the page
